          <h1>Amsterdam</h1>
          <p>The capital of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe. With its universities, academies, and research institutes, along with more than 40 museums, numerous theaters, and entertainment venues, Amsterdam is the country's leading cultural center. In addition, the city is famous for its historic homes, laid out in a pattern of concentric segments in the shape of a fan and built on piles driven through an upper layer of mud into the firm, sandy bottom up to 18 meters below. All told, some 6,750 buildings dating from the 16th to 18th centuries are crowded into an area of 2,000 acres, dissected by 160 canals (grachten), themselves home to numerous houseboats. Many picturesque bridges link the city's 90 islands, eight of them old wooden bascule bridges, including the Magere Brug (Mager Bridge), one of the city's most frequently photographed.</p>
          <p>Alongside wooden clogs, windmills, and tulips, the Amsterdam Canals spring to mind when anyone mentions Holland. A canal cruise along the Amsterdam Canals is undoubtedly the number one attraction and for first time visitors like me, a canal cruise is a great introduction to the city. </p>
          <p>There are only in fact 409 bridges connecting Venice’s canals. Amsterdam actually has 1281 bridges. That’s three times as many as Venice!</p>
          <p>881,000: That’s approximately the number of bicycles in Amsterdam. Oddly enough, there are only about 799,400 people living in the city. Some estimates say around 100,000 bicycles are stolen each year. That might account for the discrepancy between the numbers of residents and bicycles!</p>
          <p>The whole of Amsterdam plus some more is entirely built on water. In fact you might notice how some buildings are a bit lop-sided – it’s because the soil underneath is so swampy. Buildings in Amsterdam actually have to be built on long poles that get dug deep into the ground to prevent them from sinking right down underwater. They used to use wooden poles but now they use concrete. It’s a long and loud process… </p>

        <h2>The Dutch Language</h2>
        <p>Dutch is a language which is spoken by an estimated sixteen million citizens of Denmark and six million citizens of Flanders. The language is also used by people in some regions of various European countries. Dutch ranks as the sixth widely spoken language in the European Union. When you learn the language, you will be able to understand the dialect of the people if you were to visit countries in Europe like Belgium or The Netherlands. Why Should I Learn Dutch?</p>
        <p>Afrikaans is rather interesting due to it being a South African language with Dutch roots. Native speakers of Afrikaans take pride in the language and view it as a symbol of their unique culture. The language even has its own monument in Western Cape Province, South Africa</p>

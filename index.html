          <h1>Amsterdam</h1>
          <p>Alongside wooden clogs, windmills, and tulips, the Amsterdam Canals spring to mind when anyone mentions Holland. A canal cruise along the Amsterdam Canals is undoubtedly the number one attraction and for first time visitors like me, a canal cruise is a great introduction to the city. </p>
          <p>There are only in fact 409 bridges connecting Venice’s canals. Amsterdam actually has 1281 bridges. That’s three times as many as Venice!</p>

        <h2>Dutch</h2>
        <p>Dutch is a language which is spoken by an estimated sixteen million citizens of Denmark and six million citizens of Flanders. The language is also used by people in some regions of various European countries. Dutch ranks as the sixth widely spoken language in the European Union. When you learn the language, you will be able to understand the dialect of the people if you were to visit countries in Europe like Belgium or The Netherlands.
Why Should I Learn Dutch?</p>
        <p>Afrikaans is rather interesting due to it being a South African language with Dutch roots. Native speakers of Afrikaans take pride in the language and view it as a symbol of their unique culture. The language even has its own monument in Western Cape Province, South Africa</p>

          <p>A bell tower, situated over the main entrance, was built in 1684—the original bell, the oldest in South Africa, was cast in Amsterdam in 1697 by the East-Frisian bellmaker Claude Fremy, and weighs just over 300 kilograms (660 lb).</p>
